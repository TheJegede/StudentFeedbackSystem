# Capstone Project - Building a Full End-to-End Web Application that saves student data.

## TL;DR
Design and implement a serverless application that securely stores and manages student data using AWS services, We want to create a website that saves student data (feedback), then we will then run sentiment analysis on those feedbacks that have been submitted.

## Cost
All services used are eligible for the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/).  Outside of the Free Tier, there may be small charges associated with building the app (less than $1 USD).

## The Application Code
The application code is here in this repository.
